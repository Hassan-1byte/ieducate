          Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition
          of knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, and habits. Educational
          methods include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion and
          directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance
          of educators, however learners can also educate themselves. Education
          can take place in formal or informal settings and any experience that
          has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be
          considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called
          pedagogy. Formal education is commonly divided formally into such
          stages as preschool or kindergarten, primary school, secondary school
          and then college, university, or apprenticeship. There are movements
          for education reforms, such as for improving quality and efficiency of
          education towards applicable relevance in the students' lives and
          efficient problem solving in modern or future society at large or for
          evidence-based education methodologies.

          Education in Pakistan is overseen by the Federal Ministry of Education
          and the provincial governments, whereas the federal government mostly
          assists in curriculum development, accreditation and in the financing
          of research and development. Article 25-A of Constitution of Pakistan
          obligates the state to provide free and compulsory quality education
          to children of the age group 5 to 16 years. "The State shall provide
          free and compulsory education to all children of the age of five to
          sixteen years in such a manner as may be determined by law". The
          education system in Pakistan is generally divided into six levels:
          preschool (for the age from 3 to 5 years), primary (grades one through
          five), middle (grades six through eight), high (grades nine and ten,
          leading to the Secondary School Certificate or SSC), intermediate
          (grades eleven and twelve, leading to a Higher Secondary School
          Certificate or HSSC), and university programs leading to undergraduate
          and graduate degrees.

          Information technology in Pakistan is a growing industry that has the
          potential to expand more in the future. Matters relating to the IT
          industry are overseen by the Ministry of Information Technology of the
          Government of Pakistan.The IT industry is regarded as a successful
          sector of Pakistan economically, even during financial crisis.The
          first IT policy and implementation strategy was approved under the
          leadership of Prof. Atta-ur-Rahman FRS, then Federal Minister of
          Science & Technology, in August 2000 which laid the foundations of the
          development of this sector.Thereafter two policies were launched by
          the Ministry of IT under the leadership of Anusha Rahman Khan, Federal
          Minister for IT and Telecom (2013-2018).The World Economic Forum,
          assessing the development of Information and Communication Technology
          in the country ranked Pakistan 111th among 144 countries in the Global
          Information Technology report of 2014.
